# LINQ Projects

This repository contains the following LINQ-oriented project assignments:

- [Steam BD](steam)
- [IMBD](imdb)
- [NASA Exoplanets DB](nasaexo)
- [4X Game](4x)
- [Recursive Inventory](recinvent)

The goal of these assignments is to teach database concepts to undergraduate
students in interdisciplinary degree programs, where teaching databases as a
standalone course is not practical. The projects were developed for a CS2-level
programming course, where LINQ and basic database concepts are lectured, and
have been shown to effectively engage students and improve their understanding
of queries and data manipulation.
